# Esyms Interview

Please create a simple RESTFul API using Express.Js and Mongoose that can perform CRUD operations on a patient profile.

Example of a patient profile API response: https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.esyms.com/nano.json

Code can be written either in Javascript or Typescript.

Important things to consider:
- Which fields can be changed by a patient? 
- Which fields to ignore and why? 
- How can we verify the request is coming from someone that should get access to the profile?
- Make small commits with good commit message.
- Unit/Integration tests to cover the basic CRUD operations
- Ensure that you have a gitignore file

[Extra] Helpful but not necessary
- Static code analysis/linters
- Deploy the server on Heroku
- Add github action to run the tests automatically
- Build an UI to enter/delete the patient profiles

#### When you are done, give me a shout on whatsapp and we can set up a code review/interview session.
